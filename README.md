BID Dataset is composed of images of Brazilian identification documents divided into eight classes: front and back faces of National Driver's License (CNH), CNH front face, CNH back face, Natural Persons Register (CPF) front face, CPF back face, General Registration (RG) front face, RG back face, and RG front and back faces.
