In the annotations the field region_attributes contains the classes and infos.

The field info_type can be "d" or "p". If "d" the region contains a "default" text of document background, but if "p" the region contains a personal 
information and was change to create the BID dataset. 

The field text_type contains the text class of the region, if "d" the information is not relevant, because didn't contais a personal information. 
Otherwise, contains the class name like "nome" ("name" in portuguese), "data" ("date" in portuguese) and so on.

The field transcription contains the text in the region if the information is not personal (info_type = "d"), otherwise contains only a "X".

All the annotations was did in the original image that contains sigilous data and can't be shared.

Hope that can help your work. Thanks!
